    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
    <br>

    <h3>What is "aGOtool"?</h3>
    <p>It is <b>a Gene Ontology enrichment tool</b>. This site can be used for functional annotation enrichment for proteomics data. It contains tools for abundance corrected GO-term, UniProt-keyword, and KEGG-pathway enrichment.</p>

    <h3>What is enrichment analysis?</h3>
    <p>Enrichment analysis is frequently used to examine "-omics" data sets for enriched functional terms in a subset of the data set, such as regulated genes or modified proteins. It involves a statistical test to find significant differences in the frequency of GO-terms associated with e.g. modified proteins relative to their frequency in the genome.</p>

    <h3>Why use aGOtool?</h3>
    <p>There are many GO enrichment tools freely available, so why would I want to use aGOtool instead? aGOtool stands out,
        because it was <b>specifically designed for the abundance bias in Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data</b>.
        This bias exists, since proteins can't be amplified, and abundant proteins are more likely to be detected by MS.
        This effect is even more pronounced when investigating post-translationally-modified (PTM) proteins, due to the fact
        that site occupancy is usually not as high as 100%. Meaning, that not every single copy of a given protein will have the PTM of
        interest at the same location. Therefore, it will be easier to detect PTMs on abundant proteins compared to low abundant proteins.</p>
    <p>A GO-enrichment analyses comparing post-translationally modified proteins to unmodified proteins is likely to reveal enriched
        GO-terms associated with abundant proteins, rather than modified proteins specifically. We have developed a method
        to correct for this bias (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038%2Fnmeth.3621">publication</a> or explanation below)
        and this freely accessible web-tool, which you are most welcome to use.</p>
        This will result in
    <ul>
        <li>a comparison to an appropriate control group</li>
        <li>increased specificity</li>
        <li>fewer significantly enriched, but more accurate and biologically meaningful terms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How can I use aGOtool?</h3>
    Upload a list of UniProt protein accession numbers for your foreground (e.g. a list of proteins with a PTM), and a list accession numbers and their abundance values for the background.

    <h3>ToDo: What is the "foreground" and "background" proteome?</h3>
    The foreground consists of proteins is what you are interested in, to characterize for example proteins with PTMs, or upregulated proteins due to a treatment.
    The background is what you compare against. ToDoL


    The foreground is a subset of the background, in terms of abundance values.
    <br>

    <h3>How does aGOtool work?</h3>
    The user is asked to provide a foreground proteome (list of UniProt accession numbers) and a background
    proteome (list of accessions) and their corresponding abundance values. Instead of comparing the foreground to the entire proteome, it is instead
    compared to the (experimentally measured) background proteome. Furtheremore,  a correction for the abundance range is incorporated into the
    analysis as follows.<br>
    The abundance values of the foreground are assumed to be the same as the background. Based on the abundance
    values of the foreground proteome 100 bins are created (background proteins outside of that range are disregarded). For
    each bin a <b>correction factor</b> \(w_i\) is calculated by dividing the number of foreground proteins \(n_{fi}\) by the number of background proteins \(n_{bi}\) occurring
    within that bin.
    $$w_i = {n_{fi} \over n_{bi} } $$
    <br>
    For each GO-term a contingency table is constructed in order to calculate Fisher’s exact test. Where for a given GO-term
    <ul>
        <li>\(a\) is the number of all positively associated proteins (with that GO-term) of the foreground,</li>
        <li>\(b\) is the number of all non-associated proteins of the foreground,</li>
        <li>\(c\) is the number of all positively associated proteins of the background, and</li>
        <li>\(d\) is the number of all non-associated proteins of the background.</li>
    </ul>
    <table style="width:30%">
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>foreground</th>
        <th>background</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>\(a\)</td>
        <td>\(c\)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>\(b\)</td>
        <td>\(d\)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    Let \(hasGoTerm(p)\) be defined as
    $$hasGOterm(p) = \begin{cases} 1, \text{if p has the GOterm of interest} \over 0, \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
    and \(hasnotGOterm(p)\) be defined as
    $$hasnotGOterm(p) = \begin{cases} 1, \text{if p has not the GOterm of interest} \over 0, \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
    and \(prot_i\) be the set of proteins in the \(i^{th}\) bin.<p>
    Thus the four values (\(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\)) for the Fisher’s exact test are calculated as follows:
    $$a = {\sum_{i=1}^{i=100} \sum_{p∈prot_i} hasGOterm(p)}$$
    $$b = {\sum_{i=1}^{i=100} \sum_{p∈prot_i} hasnotGOterm(p)}$$
    $$c = {\sum_{i=1}^{i=100} w_i \sum_{p∈prot_i} hasGOterm(p)}$$
    $$d = {\sum_{i=1}^{i=100} w_i \sum_{p∈prot_i} hasnotGOterm(p)}$$
    Notice that \(a\) and \(b\) are calculated in the conventional way, in contrast to \(c\) and \(d\), where \(w_i\) is introduced in order to match the distribution of the foreground.<p>

    In short, \(a\) and \(b\) are calculated by simply counting (summing) the associations for all the proteins in the foreground. While \(c\) and \(d\) are calculated by summing the appropriate correction-factors.</p>

    <h3>I only have a foreground proteome, can I still use aGOtool?</h3>
    Yes, you have 2 options:
    <ul>
        <li>You can select a reference background proteome (and their corresponding abundance values) appropriate for your organism/cell-line.</li>
        <li>You can compare your foreground to the entire proteome (of your organism/cell-line) and not apply abundance correction.</li>
    </ul>
