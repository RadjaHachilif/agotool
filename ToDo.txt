I would make a filtering option for the foreground size (slider), and also visualize the larger terms as even
more transparent, because they are less informative and therefore less interesting to see than the small terms

sort order of plotting the dots, should start with large terms then small ones so they overlay properly

browser testing service

mouse zoom epilepsy fix

click on plot and highlight in table

don't resize plot on edges

same color for each for each category

Linkouts should be underlined
